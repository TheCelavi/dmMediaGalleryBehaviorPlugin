This is the presentation of the concept: from the simple widgets and behaviors, we are creating the complex stuffs.

Now, we are all trying to find out the way how to create a media gallery plugin, isn't?

So there are a lot of plugins for that, some photo gallery, video gallery etc... Even I have created a several...

In basic - the media gallery (lets say a photo gallery) is collection of the simple media widgets (or photo widgets, if you like...)

The rendering is problem ... how to be easy to end user? 

Well, just attach this behavior - you will still have a widgets, but you can easily setup how this widgets will be displayed.

Media Gallery widgets? Go to trash can!!!! :D

Hope you like this!
